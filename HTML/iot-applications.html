      <p>
        Hi everyone, my name is Agamjot Singh (Roll no - 2110994833), I am 20 years old and I am persuing bachelor of 
        Software Engeneering Honors with Deakin University, Australia. I am excited and entrigued for SIT209.

     <h2 >Activity 1 : IOT APPLICATION</h2>
     
     <p>     
       IoT applicationss are software programmes that run on IoT devices or connect different IoT devices, to fullfil multiple or
       specific goals. Some primary goals of IoT Applications are to -
          <ul>  
         <li>Displays the data collected from sensors and other devices on its network/database</li>

         <li>Statistically organizing the data</li>
      
         <li>Using the collected data to execute a process</li>
         </ul>
      
      </p>
        
    </div><br>

     <div>
      <h2 >Activity 2: Smart Building</h2>
      <p>
       "Smart" means being able to understand the enviornament, adapt and change accordingly so that the living environment 
       of the users can be enhanced.This also means collecting the data and storing it into the database for monitoring, improving
       and automating various tasks. Such as smart house with automatic lighting, smart doors, smart airconditioning etc.

    <div>
       <h2>Activity 3: Control Inetrface</h2>
       <P>
        Some high level features of the control interface is smart parking system, effecient security system, fire prevention system
        (incase of an emergency), logging and backing the data or providing realtime data to users for efficent functioning. 
        The users of these interfaces will be the resisdents, visitors, staff members, security and maintainence staff.
        Some of the sensors that are required for the systems are - 
        <ul>
          <li>Temperature and humidity Sensor</li>
          <li>Weight Sensor</li>
          <li>Motion Sensor</li>
          <li>Rfid System</li>
          <li>Smoke Sensor</li>
        </ul>      
       </P>
